## Suggestions for a better code

### Better Python code (Advices, Pydantic etc.)

- [x] [mCoding - 25 nooby Python habits you need to ditch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUeud6DvOWI)
  - Use fstrings instead manual string formatting (using `+` operator)
  - Use `with` statement instead of `open` and `close` methods
  - Use context managers instead of `try` and `finally` statements
  - Capture actual exceptions instead of `except Exception`
  - Caret means XOR, not exponentiation
  - If we want a mutable default argument, use `None` and set it to a default value inside the function and then check if it's `None`
  - Use dict, list, set, generator comprehensions instead of `for` loops; use them where it makes sense
  - We don't need to turn every single loop into a comprehension
  - Don't check for a type with `==`, use `isinstance` instead
