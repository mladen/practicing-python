    > DEFINITION: Process: An instance of a program (e.g. a Python interpreter, a web browser, a text editor)
    >
    >> Advantages of processes:
    >> + Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
    >> + Separate memory space, each process has its own memory ->> Memory is not shared between processes
    >> + Great for CPU-bound processing
    >> + New process is started independently from the first process (from other processes)
    >> + Processes are interruptible/killable
    >> + One GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) for each process -> avoids GIL limitation
    >
    >> Disadvantages of processes:
    >> - Heavyweight
    >> - Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
    >> - More memory
    >> - IPC (Inter-process communication) is more complicated
    >
    > DEFINITION: Thread: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (for execution) (also known as a lightweight process)
    > A process can spawn multiple threads
    >
    >> Advantages of threads:
    >> + All threads within a process share the same memory
    >> + Lightweight
    >> + Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
    >> + Great for I/O-bound tasks (When our program has to talk to slow devices like talking to a hard drive, a network connection, a database...our program can use the time waiting for these devices and then intelligently switch to another thread to do something else).
    >
    >> Disadvantages of threads:
    >> - Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread can execute Python code at once (even on a multi-core processor) so there is no actual parallelism
    >> - NOTE: No effect for CPU-bound tasks (like math calculations, image and video processing etc.) because of GIL
    >> - Not interruptible/killable
    >> - Careful with race conditions (when two or more threads try to modify the same variable at the same time - this can cause unexpected behavior, bugs or crashes)
    >
    > DEFINITION: GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python (even on a multi-core processor)
    >> - It is needed because CPython (the reference implementation of Python) is not thread-safe. -> That means that multiple threads can't execute Python bytecodes at once.
    >> - It is a performance bottleneck in CPU-bound tasks (like math calculations, image and video processing etc.)
    >> - It is not a problem for I/O-bound tasks (like talking to a hard drive, a network connection, a database, a web server etc.)
    >> - It is not a problem for multi-threaded C extensions (like NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV etc.)
    >
    > If we want to avoid the GIL but still want to use parallel computing we can use:
    >> - multiprocessing module (for CPU-bound tasks)
    >> - use a different, free-threaded Python implementation (like Jython, IronPython, PyPy)
    >> - use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (like C++ libraries) -> this is how NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV etc. work
    >> - asyncio module (for I/O-bound tasks) TODO: check this
    >> - concurrent.futures module (for both CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks) TODO: check this
    >
    >> QUESTION: Why is the GIL needed? \
    >> A GIL is needed because in CPython there is a memory management that is not thread-safe. So, in CPython there is a technique called reference counting that is used to manage memory. This means that objects created in Python have a reference count variable that keeps track of the number of references that point to the object. When this count reaches zero, the memory occupied by the object is released. The problem now in multi-threading is that this reference count variable needs protection from race conditions where two threads increase or decrease the value simultaneously. So, if this happens it can either cause leaked memory that is never released or it can incorrectly release memory (that is still in use) while the reference to that object still exists. This is the reason why CPython has a GIL.

## Suggestions for a better code

### Notes

- NOTE: Avoid importing everything from a module (e.g. `from module import *`)

### Better Python code (Advices, Pydantic etc.)

- [x] [mCoding - 25 nooby Python habits you need to ditch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUeud6DvOWI)
  - Use fstrings instead manual string formatting (using `+` operator)
  - Use `with` statement instead of `open` and `close` methods
  - Use context managers instead of `try` and `finally` statements
  - Capture actual exceptions instead of `except Exception`
  - Caret means XOR, not exponentiation
  - If we want a mutable default argument, use `None` and set it to a default value inside the function and then check if it's `None`
  - Use dict, list, set, generator comprehensions instead of `for` loops; use them where it makes sense
  - We don't need to turn every single loop into a comprehension
  - Don't check for a type with `==`, use `isinstance` instead
- [ ] [mCoding - 21 MORE nooby Python habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8NijUYfyus)
- [x] [mCoding - You should put this in all your Python scripts | if **name** == '**main**': ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_wlZ9IhbTs)

  - NOTE: (My note) A file with this line can be used both as a standalone script **with executable code** and as an importable module **with reusable functions**.
  - This is a good practice to prevent code from running when the script is imported as a module into another script.
    > (In other words - this is useful when you want to be able to import the script as a module in another script without running the code in the script you're importing.)
  - Not every file is a script (which is a file we intend to run), some are modules.
  - The `if __name__ == "__main__"` is a "signal" to the Python interpreter (and to the reader of the code) that the script is being run as the main program.
  - If we don't see this line than we can assume that the script is being imported as a module and that **we should NOT run the code** in it.
  - We're using the `main` function to encapsulate the code that we want to run when the script is run as the main program. That way we don't have global variables and functions that can be accidentally called when the script is imported as a module.
  - The syntax (placed in the **main** script) is as follows (NOTE: the `main` function is just a convention, it can be named differently):

    ```python
      def main():
          # code here

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          main()
    ```
